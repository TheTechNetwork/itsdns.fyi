  <h1 class="glitch">itsdns.fyi: We Wouldn't Download a Website... Would You?</h1>
  <p>You think you control the internet?  Think again, meatbag. Welcome to the rabbit hole that is itsdns.fyi, the internet's most dubious website name translator (don't judge, it was on sale).</p>

  <h2>The Black Market of IP Addresses</h2>
  <p>Forget sunshine and rainbows. Here's the truth: websites are just elaborate scams, a front for the real business - IP addresses.  Those long, cryptic numbers are the internet's true currency, and itsdns.fyi is the shady organization controlling the black market.</p>
  <img src="/src/images/itsdns-evenwhennot.jpg" alt="it was dns" width="200">  <p>We're the ones whispering numbers into your browser's ear, translating your pleas for cat videos into the cold, hard cash of the digital underworld.  And let's be honest, half the time we just pick whatever random website makes us chuckle. </p>

  <h2 class="warning">Disclaimer: We are not responsible for existential dread, rickrolls, or sudden urges to buy novelty socks. </h2>  
  <p>Without itsdns.fyi, you'd be endlessly wandering the wasteland of IP addresses, doomed to stumble upon questionable content at best. So next time you reach a website, thank your lucky stars for the chaos that is itsdns.fyi. Because the alternative is far worse.  We could send you to a rickroll... or something much, much weirder.</p>

  <p>We are itsdns.fyi. We are the glitch in the matrix. We are the reason you might get rickrolled... or worse.  You're welcome. (We're mostly kidding... maybe.)</p>
