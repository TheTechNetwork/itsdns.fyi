# DNS: The Tragicomedy - Advanced Absurd Troubleshooting Simulator v4

![DNS Simulator Logo](https://itsdns.fyi/dns-simulator-logo.webp)

## Welcome to the Void of DNS Despair!

Are you tired of DNS just working? Do you miss the thrill of inexplicable network issues? Look no further! The DNS Tragicomedy Simulator is here to fulfill your wildest troubleshooting nightmares!

### Features:

- **Realistic Unrealism**: Experience DNS problems so absurd, they might actually happen in production!
- **Career Advancement**: Climb the ladder from "DNS Novice" to "Transcendent TLD Tamer" without the pesky need for actual skills!
- **Caffeine Tracking**: Monitor your virtual coffee consumption as you spiral into madness!
- **Matrix-style Background**: Because nothing says "I'm a serious network professional" like green falling characters!
- **Dark/Light Theme**: Toggle between "Eye Strain" and "Retina Burn" modes!

### Installation:

1. Clone this repository into your darkest, most forgotten server room.
2. Perform a sacred ritual involving three CAT6 cables and a rubber duck.
3. Run `npm install` (or just scream "INSTALL" at your computer, both are equally effective).
4. Launch with `npm start` and kiss your sanity goodbye.

### Usage:

1. Click "Embrace the Void" to begin your descent into DNS madness.
2. Diagnose, Fix, or Escalate your way through increasingly absurd DNS crises.
3. Collect Despair Points and climb the ranks of DNS mastery.
4. Question your career choices.
5. Repeat until you've achieved enlightenment or a mental breakdown (whichever comes first).

### Contributing:

Found a bug? Congratulations, it's now a feature! But if you insist on "fixing" things:

1. Fork this repository (no, not with an actual fork).
2. Create a branch named after your favorite DNS record type.
3. Commit your changes with messages that exclusively use DNS puns.
4. Submit a pull request and pray to the RFC gods.

### Disclaimer:

This simulator is for entertainment purposes only. Any resemblance to actual DNS troubleshooting is purely coincidental and frankly, concerning. Side effects may include uncontrollable laughter, increased caffeine dependency, and the urge to debug your home router at 3 AM.

Remember: In DNS we trust, but in this simulator, trust no one!
