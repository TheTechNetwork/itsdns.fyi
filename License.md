# The "What Even Is DNS Anyway?" Public License (WEIDAPL)

Version 4.0.4, April 1, 2024

## Preamble

This license is as stable as a DNS server during a DDoS attack and as clear as a wildcard CNAME record. By using, copying, modifying, or distributing this software, you agree to be bound by the terms of this license, or may the packet loss be ever in your disfavor.

## Terms and Conditions

0. Definitions
   - "Software" refers to this DNS Simulator and any associated documentation, which may or may not exist in this plane of reality.
   - "You" refers to the poor soul brave enough to use this software.
   - "We" refers to the collective consciousness of sleep-deprived network administrators who created this monstrosity.

1. Grant of License
   You are hereby granted the right to use this software for the purpose of simulating DNS-related existential crises, subject to the following conditions:

   a) You must maintain this license and copyright notice in all copies of the software.
   b) You agree to sacrifice at least one router to the RFC gods every full moon.
   c) You solemnly swear that you are up to no good (network-wise).

2. Restrictions
   You may not use this software for:
   
   a) Actual DNS management (for the love of all that is holy, please don't).
   b) Teaching people that DNS is reliable or straightforward.
   c) Convincing yourself that you understand DNS (nobody does, let's be honest).

3. Disclaimer of Warranty
   This software is provided "as is", with all faults, defects, bugs, and cosmic anomalies. Any resemblance to functional DNS software is purely coincidental.

4. Limitation of Liability
   In no event shall the authors be liable for any claim, damages, or other liability arising from the use of this software, including but not limited to:
   
   a) Spontaneous hair loss due to DNS-related stress.
   b) Uncontrollable urges to reboot devices at 3 AM.
   c) Temporary or permanent loss of sanity.
   d) The sudden realization that your entire career is based on a system held together by duct tape and wishful thinking.

5. Contributions
   By contributing to this project, you agree to forfeit any claims to sanity and acknowledge that your code may be used to further confuse and befuddle future generations of network administrators.

6. Termination
   This license is effective until terminated by you throwing your computer out the window in frustration. However, the psychological effects of using this software may be permanent.

7. Governing Law
   This license shall be governed by the laws of the DNS realm, as interpreted by a panel of your most caffeinated colleagues.

## Conclusion

By using this software, you acknowledge that DNS is both the glue that holds the internet together and the bane of every network administrator's existence. May your TTLs be low and your uptime be high.

Remember: It's always DNS, even when it's not.
